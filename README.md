# Integrations Management

## About

This repository contains tooling for streamlining and automating the setup and maintenance of Datadog integrations.

## Quick Installation

The resources in this project are primarily intended to be utilized in guided setup and management flows within the Datadog UI.

## Getting Started

Open the relevant integration in https://app.datadoghq.com/integrations to set up or manage your integrations. The integrations listed in this repository have setup flows that utilize the tooling stored here.

## Building Locally

Shell scripts and Terraform assets stored within this repo may be run, debugged, and developed locally. They require minimal external dependencies--only a compatible python version (as listed in the `pyproject.toml` per sub-directory) and/or Terraform installation.
